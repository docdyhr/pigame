## Todo list for pigame:

### Next Steps (High Priority)
1. Implement interactive practice mode
   - Add `--practice` flag for interactive digit-by-digit input
   - Implement immediate feedback on each digit
   - Save progress between sessions

2. Add statistics tracking
   - Create ~/.pigame directory for user data
   - Track accuracy and improvement over time
   - Add `--stats` command to show historical performance

3. Support for additional constants
   - Add e, φ, √2 with high-precision calculations
   - Include historical information for each constant

4. Create a web-based version
   - Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
   - Responsive design for mobile devices

### User Interface Improvements
* ✅ Add proper spacing between numbers to increase readability
* ✅ Support for color-blind mode (different highlighting method)
* Interactive mode for practicing pi memorization
  - Add interactive input for each digit with immediate feedback
  - Support arrow keys to navigate/correct previous entries
  - Add progress visualization (e.g., progress bar)
* Support for dark/light terminal themes
  - Detect terminal theme using environment variables
  - Add `--theme [dark|light|auto]` option
  - Create a consistent color scheme for both themes

### Technical Improvements
* ✅ Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
* ✅ Add more comprehensive testing
* ✅ Improve pi calculation algorithm in C implementation
* ✅ Add proper error messages for all edge cases
* Add consistent logging across all implementations
  - Implement a common logging interface for all implementations
  - Add log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  - Add option to output logs to file
* Improve performance of pi calculation in all implementations
  - Optimize algorithms for speed and memory usage
  - Add benchmarking tools to compare implementations
  - Implement caching for frequently used precision levels
* Add configuration file support
  - Support for ~/.pigame/config.{json,yaml,toml}
  - Store default settings and preferences
  - Allow overriding with command-line options

### New Features
* Add a practice mode that gradually increases difficulty
  - Implement an interactive mode with `--practice` flag
  - Start with fewer digits and increase based on success
  - Add option to retry after mistakes
  - Store progress between sessions
* Add statistics tracking (e.g., how many digits you've memorized over time)
  - Create a ~/.pigame/ directory for storing user data
  - Track accuracy, improvement over time, and max digits achieved
  - Add `--stats` flag to show historical performance
* Add a difficulty rating system
  - Rating from 1-10 based on number of digits and time
  - Award achievements for reaching milestones
* Add a timer mode
  - Add `--timer` flag to measure response time
  - Set time limits with `--time-limit SECONDS` option
  - Show performance metrics compared to average users

### Documentation
* ✅ Create man page
* ✅ Add tutorial for new users (in README)
* Document the algorithm used for calculating pi in each implementation
  - Add explanations of each algorithm with mathematical notation
  - Compare accuracy and performance characteristics
  - Include references to relevant academic papers
* ✅ Add development guidelines for contributors (in CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Add internationalization support
  - Add translations for UI text and help messages
  - Support for localized number formats
  - Add documentation in multiple languages
* Create a project website
  - Showcase features and implementations
  - Provide online documentation
  - Include interactive demo

### Implementations

  - Consider a Vue.js or React implementation for interactivity
* Create a GUI version with a graphical display of pi
  - Use cross-platform toolkit like Qt or GTK
  - Add visualizations (circular representation of pi, etc.)
  - Support export/sharing of results and achievements
* Support for other mathematical constants (e, √2, φ, etc.)
  - Add `--constant [pi|e|phi|sqrt2]` option
  - Implement high-precision calculations for each constant
  - Include historical information and fun facts for each constant
* Add additional language implementations
  - Consider Rust for performance and safety
  - Consider a Go implementation for simplicity
  - Add JVM language implementation (Java/Kotlin)

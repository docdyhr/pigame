## Todo list for pigame:
* implement method where it's possible to see differences if False match. Can you use the unix diff program? Is it possible to colourize mistakes!? If then how?
* Expand functionality to show pi with different numbers of decimals with a flag
* Use getopts, see help getopts or man bash /getopts to expand the script
